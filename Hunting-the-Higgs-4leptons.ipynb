    "According to the standard model, one of the ways the Higgs boson can decay is by first creating two Z bosons that then decay further into four leptons (electrons, muons...). It isn't the only process with such a final state, of course, so one has to sift through quite a lot of noise to see that happening. The theory doesn't say too much about what the mass of Higgs could be, but some clever assumptions and enlightened guesses can get you pretty far. For an example, four lepton decay is very dominant in some mass regions, which then guides our search."
