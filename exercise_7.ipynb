Instead of hiding somewhere under ready made graphs, it is now yours to explore. The example is based on the original code in [http://opendata.cern.ch/record/5500] on the CERN Open Data portal (Jomhari, Nur Zulaiha; Geiser, Achim; Bin Anuar, Afiq Aizuddin; (2017). Higgs-to-four-lepton analysis example using 2011-2012 data. CERN Open Data Portal.

First we have some theoretical background, then we make measurements and try to see if those measurements contain something that correlates or clashes with our assumptions. Perhaps the results confirm our expectations, bring up new questions to look into, force us to adapt our theories or require entirely new ones to explain them. This cycle then continues time and time again."

    "According to the standard model, one of the ways the Higgs boson can decay is by first creating two Z bosons that then decay further into four leptons (electrons, muons...). It isn't the only process with such a final state, of course, so one has to sift through quite a lot of noise to see that happening. The theory doesn't say too much about what the mass of Higgs could be, but some clever assumptions and enlightened guesses can get you pretty far. For an example, four lepton decay is very dominant in some mass regions, which then guides our search."
